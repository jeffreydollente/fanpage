<h1 style= "font-size:40px;"> Bob Marley - Biography</h1>
    <p>
        Jamaican singer, musician and songwriter Bob Marley served as a world ambassador for reggae music<br> and sold more than 20 million records throughout his career.
       <h2> Who Is Bob Marley?</h2>
        In 1963, Bob Marley and his friends formed the Wailing Wailers. <br>
        The Wailers' big break came in 1972 when they landed a contract with Island Records.<br>
        Marley went on to sell more than 20 million records throughout his career,<br>
        making him the first international superstar to emerge from the so-called Third World.
        
        <h2>Early Life in Jamaica</h2>
        Born on February 6, 1945, in St. Ann Parish, Jamaica, Marley helped introduce reggae music to the world<br>
        and remains one of the genre's most beloved artists to this day. The son of a black teenage mother and much older, later absent white father, <br>
        he spent his early years in St. Ann Parish, in the rural village known as Nine Miles.
        
        <br>One of his childhood friends in St. Ann was Neville "Bunny" O'Riley Livingston. Attending the same school, the two shared a love of music. <br>
        Bunny inspired Marley to learn to play the guitar. Later Livingston's father <br>
        and Marley's mother became involved, and they all lived together for a time in Kingston, according to Christopher John Farley's Before the Legend: <br>
        <i>The Rise of Bob Marley.</i>

 <p>Old pirates, yes, they rob I
    Sold I to the merchant ships
    Minutes after they took I
    From the bottomless pit  <br> 
    But my hand was made strong
    By the hand of the almighty
    We forward in this generation
 Triumphantly  <br> 
    Won't you help to sing
    These songs of freedom
    'Cause all I ever have
    Redemption songs
    Redemption songs  <br> 
    Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
    None but ourselves can free our minds
    Have no fear for atomic energy
    <br>  'Cause none of them can stop the time
    How long shall they kill our prophets
    While we stand aside and look
    Oh!   <br> Some say it's just a part of it
    We've got to fulfill the book
    Won't you help to sing
    These songs of freedom
    'Cause all I ever have  <br> 
    Redemption songs
    Redemption songs
    Redemption songs
    Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery  <br> 
    None but ourselves can free our mind
    Wo! Have no fear for atomic energy  <br> 
    'Cause none of them-a can-a stop-a the time
    How long shall they kill our prophets 
    While we stand aside and look?
    <br> Yes, some say it's just a part of it
    We've got to fulfill the book <br>
    Won't you help to sing
    These songs of freedom?
    'Cause all I ever had  <br> 
    Redemption songs
    All I ever had
    Redemption songs
    These songs of freedom
    Songs of freedom</p>
